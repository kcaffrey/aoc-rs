# Advent of Code (in Rust)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kcaffrey/aoc-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kcaffrey/aoc-rs)

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 
written in Rust, using [cargo-aoc](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc) as a helper.

To run the code, follow the setup instructions for cargo-aoc and then run `cargo aoc`.
